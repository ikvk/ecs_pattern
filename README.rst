Intro
-----
| ECS - Entity-Component-System - it is an architectural pattern created for game development.

It is great for describing a dynamic virtual world.

Basic principles of ECS:

* Composition over inheritance
* Data separated from logic (Data Oriented Design)

| *Component* - Property with object data
| *Entity* - Container for properties
| *System* - Data processing logic
| *EntityManager* - Entity database
| *SystemManager* - Container for systems

Installation
------------
::

    $ pip install ecs-pattern

Guide
-----

.. code-block:: python

    from ecs_pattern import component, entity, EntityManager, System, SystemManager

* Describe components - component
* Describe entities based on components - entity
* Distribute the responsibility of processing entities by systems - System
* Store entities in entity manager - EntityManager
* Manage your systems with SystemManager

**Component**
    | Property with object data. Contains only data, no logic.

    | The component is used as a mixin in entities.

    | Use the ecs_pattern.component decorator to create components.

    | Technically this is python dataclass.

    .. code-block:: python

        @component
        class ComPosition:
            x: int = 0
            y: int = 0

        @component
        class ComPerson:
            name: str
            health: int

**Entity**
    | Container for properties. Consists of components only.

    | It is forbidden to add attributes to an entity dynamically.

    | Use the ecs_pattern.entity decorator to create entities.

    | Technically this is python dataclass with slots=True.

    .. code-block:: python

        @entity
        class Player(ComPosition, ComPerson):
            pass

        @entity
        class Ball(ComPosition):
            pass

**System**
    | Entity processing logic.

    | Does not contain data about entities and components.

    | Use the ecs_pattern.System abstract class to create concrete systems:

    .. code-block:: python

        class SysInit(System):
            def __init__(self, entities: EntityManager):
                self.entities = entities

            def start(self):
                self.entities.init(
                    TeamScoredGoalEvent(Team.LEFT),
                    Spark(spark_sprite(pygame.display.Info()), 0, 0, 0, 0)
                )
                self.entities.add(
                    GameStateInfo(play=True, pause=False),
                    WaitForBallMoveEvent(1000),
                )

        class SysGravitation(System):
            def __init__(self, entities: EntityManager):
                self.entities = entities

            def update(self):
                for entity_with_pos in self.entities.get_with_component(ComPosition):
                    if entity_with_pos.y > 0:
                        entity_with_pos.y -= 1

**EntityManager**
    | Entity database.

    | A single point of access to all entities.

    | Use the ecs_pattern class.EntityManager for creating an entity manager.

    | Time complexity of get_by_class and get_with_component - like a dict

    | *entities.add* - Add entities.

    | *entities.delete* - Delete entities.

    | *entities.delete_buffer_add* - Save entities to the delete buffer to delete later.

    | *entities.delete_buffer_purge* - Delete all entities in the deletion buffer and clear the buffer.

    | *entities.init* - Let manager know about entities. KeyError are raising on access to unknown entities.

    | *entities.get_by_class* - Get all entities of the specified classes. Respects the order of entities.

    | *entities.get_with_component* - Get all entities with the specified components.

    .. code-block:: python

        entities = EntityManager()
        entities.add(
            Player('Ivan', 20, 1, 2),
            Player('Vladimir', 30, 3, 4),
            Ball(0, 7)
        )
        for entity_with_pos in entities.get_with_component(ComPosition):
            print(entity_with_pos.x, entity_with_pos.y)
        for player_entity in entities.get_by_class(Player):
            print(player_entity.name)
            entities.delete_buffer_add(player_entity)
        entities.delete_buffer_purge()
        entities.delete(*tuple(entities.get_by_class(Ball)))  # one line del

**SystemManager**
    | Container for systems.

    | Works with systems in a given order.

    | Use the ecs_pattern.SystemManager class to manage systems.

    | *system_manager.start_systems* - Initialize systems. Call once before the main systems update cycle.

    | *system_manager.update_systems* - Update systems status. Call in the main loop.

    | *system_manager.stop_systems* - Stop systems. Call once after the main loop completes.

    .. code-block:: python

        entities = EntityManager()
        entities.add(
            Player('Ivan', 20, 1, 2),
            Player('Vladimir', 30, 3, 4),
            Ball(0, 7)
        )
        system_manager = SystemManager([
            SysPersonHealthRegeneration(entities),
            SysGravitation(entities)
        ])
        system_manager.start_systems()
        while play:
            system_manager.update_systems()
            clock.tick(24)  # *pygame clock
        system_manager.stop_systems()

Examples
--------
* `Pong game: pygame + ecs_pattern <https://github.com/ikvk/ecs_pattern/tree/master/examples/pong>`_.

Advantages
----------
* Weak code cohesion - easy to refactor and expand the codebase
* Modularity and testability of logic - easy to test and reuse code in other projects
* Hard to write bad code
* Easy to follow Single Responsibility logic
* Easy to combine entity properties
* Easy to analyze performance
* Easy to parallelize processing
* Easy to work with clean data

Difficulties
------------
It can take a lot of practice to learn how to cook ECS properly:

* Data is available from anywhere - hard to find errors
* Systems work strictly one after another
* Recursive logic is not directly supported

Newbie mistakes
---------------
* Inheritance of components, entities, systems
* Ignoring the principles of ECS, such as storing data in the system
* Raising ECS to the absolute, no one cancels the OOP
* Adaptation of the existing project code under ECS "as is"
* Use of recursive or reactive logic in systems
* Using EntityManager.delete in get_by_class, get_with_component loops

Good Practices
--------------
* Use components - flags
* Minimize component change locations
* Use event entities and event systems
* Do not use methods in components and entities
